    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Participation in an international fair organized by the university, which consisted of presenting an innovative product with export potential to a diverse audience. The event's objective was to evaluate the product's commercial viability and international reach in foreign markets.</li>
        <li>In my ninth semester at university, I conducted a research project that studied Peru's current import and export landscape and identified its relationship to the national economic cycle. It was found that the country is at a strong point in foreign trade and is expected to continue increasing due to our unique products. However, regarding the relationship, it doesn't exist because we are talking about two different variables.
        </li>
        <li>In my tenth semester of university, as a research project for graduation, I conducted a systematic study compiling all the research conducted to date on e-commerce and last-mile logistics. This work found that e-commerce is constantly growing through the use of new eco-friendly technologies in last-mile logistics. However, while the authors of the various studies only studied the short-term impact, I took it upon myself to give it a broader view and examine its long-term impact. A highly efficient and very conservative future is expected.</li>
